PREREQUISITES

	Libmpsse is currently supported on the Linux and OSX platforms.

	Libmpsse requires swig as well as the libftdi and python development packages. 
	These can typically be installed by your Linux distro's package manager, for Debian:

		# apt-get install swig libftdi-dev python-dev autoconf automake libtool

	For OSX, you will likely need to at least install libftdi from source.

INSTALLATION

	With the required prerequisites installed, libmpsse can be built and installed:

```sh
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

NOTE: I haven't setup python, yet.
